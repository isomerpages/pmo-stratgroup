<p>PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE (STRATEGY GROUP)</p>
<p></p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS</p>
<p></p>
<p>MR GAN KIM YONG</p>
<p>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF STRATEGY GROUP</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Strategy Group will continue to lead the Public Service to develop
and implement strategic priorities and tackle long-term national challenges,
to build a better Singapore for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Future Singapore – Driving Strategic Priorities for the New Term</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We begin this new term of Government in a more uncertain, fragmented,
and dangerous world. We have to contend with a changing global order, big
power contestation, and a more volatile economic outlook, which present
headwinds for a small and open economy like Singapore. We must be nimble
and adapt quickly, to continue to secure good outcomes and seize new opportunities
for Singapore and Singaporeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Strategy Group has developed a set of strategic priorities to: (a)
secure Singapore’s place in a changed world; (b) transform our economy
to keep it competitive; (c) expand opportunities and strengthen assurances
for all; (d) unite Singaporeans; and (e) forge stronger partnerships with
individuals, communities, and businesses to shape Singapore’s future together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Strategy Group will drive Whole-of-Government efforts to implement
our national priorities, while ensuring that agencies work together to
address critical cross-cutting issues, achieve greater synergies, and manage
trade-offs optimally across policy domains. At the same time, the Strategy
Group will sharpen foresight and sense-making to better anticipate future
challenges and opportunities and develop robust strategies in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our Population – Tackling Challenges and Harnessing Potential&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Government must deal with two demographic challenges – a declining
fertility rate and a rapidly ageing population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address Singapore’s low fertility rate, the Government will redouble
our efforts to support marriage and parenthood, and build a Singapore Made
For Families. We have support measures spanning housing, healthcare, and
education, to financial and caregiving support, with recent enhancements
to our parental leave schemes to provide parents with 30 weeks of paid
leave in the child’s first year. More support has also been extended to
families with three or more children through the new Large Families Scheme.
In this term, we will do more to help parents better manage their work
and family commitments, and work with stakeholders such as employers and
community partners to build a culture that celebrates and values families.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our seniors live healthier and longer lives, we will do more to harness
longevity as an opportunity. The Government will continue to support seniors
to lead active and healthy lives, stay employed if they wish, and age with
confidence. We will also enhance our built environment and service provisions,
so our seniors can be well cared for in their homes and connected to their
communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our foreign workforce and immigration policies play an important role
in mitigating the impact of low birth rates and ageing, on the economy
and society. The Government will carefully manage our foreign worker and
immigration flows, while helping newcomers integrate into our society.
We will also work with stakeholders to support new citizens in connecting
with their local communities and building stronger bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Climate Change – Securing our Longer-Term Competitiveness and Survival</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continued investment in climate action is critical for Singapore’s long-term
competitiveness and survival.&nbsp; Singapore remains committed to our
net zero emissions by 2050 target. This year, the Government announced
our target to reduce emissions to between 45 and 50 million tonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent (MtCO<sub>2</sub>e) in 2035 as part of our 2035 Nationally
Determined Contribution. We will follow through with concrete action. First,
we will work to decarbonise our energy mix, by advancing domestic solar
deployment, pursuing cross-border electricity trade, and considering potential
green energy solutions like geothermal and nuclear for the future. Second,
we will continue to pursue key mitigation measures such as carbon capture,
utilisation, and storage. Third, we will work with industry to develop
robust transition plans for businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, Singapore will need to prepare for the growing physical
impact of climate change, especially rising sea levels and heat. In addition
to our existing plans on coastal protection, we will work with businesses
and other stakeholders to strengthen climate adaptation. This includes
boosting heat resilience and partnering neighbouring countries to tackle
transboundary climate risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To support Singapore’s efforts, global cooperation and action is essential.
As such, the Government will continue to advocate for global standards
and regulations, while exploring international collaborations that support
our mitigation efforts. We have signed eight Article 6 carbon credits Implementation
Agreements to grow our pipeline of high-quality credits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building a Better Singapore for All</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government’s ability to work in an integrated and collaborative way,
as well as to think ahead and plan for the long term, has served us well
and will remain essential. As we navigate the challenges ahead, the Strategy
Group will continue to lead the Public Service in advancing today’s priorities,
while preparing for tomorrow’s possibilities.</p>
