To encourage Singaporeans to forge stronger bonds with their families, employers are encouraged to allow employees to leave work at 5pm on 19 November
2021, Friday, to have a meal with their families. In a special edition of Eat With Your Family Day, about 100 families will be enjoying a *Made For Families* evening of fun
with great prizes to be won. Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office, will be engaging the participating families on Zoom to find out what “*Made For
Families*” means to them.

The “Eat With Your Family Day is Made For Families” virtual event marks the last Eat With Your Family Day (EWYFD) of the year. This virtual event is organised by Centre for Fathering, MUMs for Life and DADs for Life, in partnership with Families for Life, in support of *Made For Families*.

Minister Indranee said: “Eat With Your Family Day is an important reminder to make time for our families. While many of us have been working from home, a lot of that time is spent on virtual meetings or emails. We should make a concerted effort to disconnect from work at regular intervals and enjoy precious moments with our loved ones. I am happy to know that there are more than 600 companies that are supportive of such family-friendly initiatives today. Family-centric companies are much more likely to have a happier and more productive workforce, find it easier to recruit and retain and have a positive work culture. Let’s all join in to build a Singapore that’s Made for Families.”

Mr Bryan Tan, Chief Executive Officer of Centre for Fathering, said: “During this COVID season when many individuals are working from home, employees often grapple with the blurred boundaries of work and life, at times working beyond normal working hours. Eat With Your Family Day reminds parents to put aside their work and devices, and connect with their children during meals. To date, over 6001 organisations are committed to Eat With Your Family Day by encouraging their employees to stop work at 5pm once every quarter to bond with their families over dinner.”

Sharon Ng, HR Director of Michelman Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, said: “A family that eats together, stays together. The Eat With Your Family Day initiative, which our company joined in 2017, is one of the family-friendly initiatives that has helped improve our employees’ work-life harmony and morale, resulting in happier and healthier employees which aids productivity.”

During the event, participants can look forward to fun and interactive games to discover more about family-friendly organisations, places, and public amenities, with
prizes to be won. Each participating family on Zoom will also receive $50 worth of foodpanda credits, which can be used to purchase any items on the foodpanda platform, or to order a hearty meal to dine at home with their family. The virtual event will also be streamed on the *Made For Families* Facebook page at www.facebook.com/MadeForFamiliesSg. Interested parties can tune in and stand a chance to win vouchers too.

***Made for Families partners***
foodpanda and Centre for Fathering are one of the many partners who have adopted the Made For Families brand mark. This signifies their commitment towards building a family-friendly Singapore, through initiatives, programmes, amenities, products, and services that support families and raising children.

Since the launch of the Made for Families brand mark in June 2020, around 80 businesses, organisations and community groups have adopted it. They come from various sectors, ranging from hospitality, leisure, food and beverage, retail and ecommerce, to government agencies and community groups. This initiative by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) in the Strategy Group, Prime Minister’s Office, aims to assure families of the support offered by the Government and community at large.
