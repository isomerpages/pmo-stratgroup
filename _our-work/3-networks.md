### **Overview**

At the Centre for Strategic Futures (CSF), we believe in actively seeking out diverse and fresh perspectives to guide policy-making in the Singapore government and better prepare ourselves for the future. These perspectives can be in terms of process – new foresight and risk methodologies – or content. We interact and exchange views with a wide range of people to help us uncover biases and blind spots for Singapore, and generate new insights about our operating environment.

CSF meets over 200 thought leaders yearly through incoming visits, overseas trips, paid consultancies, interviews and curated events. We also meet regularly with futurists from various parts of the Singapore government to share best practices and build up the practice of foresight within government.

### **Programmes**

#### **Distinguished Visitors Programme**

Introduced in 2014, the Distinguished Visitors Programme brings thought leaders to Singapore to engage in extensive discussions with senior decision makers in the Public Service.

Past Distinguished Visitors include:

#### **CSF Fellows**

Initiated in 2015, CSF Fellows engages Ph.D. students from local universities in specific research projects. Besides tapping on their expertise, the CSF aims to provide opportunities to network with local academic institutions, carving the path for future collaborations based on mutual research interests. Examples of work carried out by the students would be conducting ethnographic interviews and subsequently analysing the results and implications in order to add to strategic planning.
